An approved term in one language is paired with another approved term in another language. If the parts of speech of these multiple entries are different, then they are different terms. For example, ""plot"" can be a noun and a verb, and each can have approved status."

A term is marked as forbidden not only for being inappropriate as a translation, but also if it is inappropriate within the context of the end-result document.
A forbidden term, unlike a non-standard term, should not be provided as a translation candidate.
Note: A term is “forbidden” because it is inappropriate from linguistic, social, terminological, branding, or other viewpoints.
Up to UTX 1.11, only a target term could be indicated as forbidden. UTX 1.20 allows any term (including a source term) to be indicated as forbidden.
Forbidden terms can be exported from a UTX glossary for terminological checking. Based on this information, a function of a translation tool or a dedicated terminological checker can ascertain whether translation files contain any undesirable terms."
